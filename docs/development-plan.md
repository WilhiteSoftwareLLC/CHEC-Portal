# Development Plan: Develop Page Feature

## Overview
Add a new "Develop" page to the CHEC Portal that allows admin users to execute aider commands and deploy application changes directly from the web interface, without requiring command line access.

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Develop Page**: New page accessible from dashboard navigation
2. **Prompt Input**: Large text area for entering aider prompts
3. **Submit Button**: Executes aider command with the provided prompt
4. **Results Display**: Read-only text area showing aider command output
5. **Deploy Button**: Builds and redeploys the application
6. **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for command execution and deployment status

### User Interface Components
- **Prompt Text Area**: Multi-line input for aider commands
- **Submit Button**: Triggers aider execution
- **Results Text Area**: Displays command output (read-only, scrollable)
- **Deploy Button**: Triggers build and deployment process
- **Status Indicators**: Loading states, success/error messages
- **Clear/Reset Buttons**: Clear prompt and results areas

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/develop/execute` - Execute aider command
- `POST /api/develop/deploy` - Build and deploy application
- `GET /api/develop/status` - Check execution/deployment status

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Frontend Components
1. Create `client/src/pages/develop.tsx`
2. Add Develop navigation card to dashboard
3. Implement UI components:
   - Prompt input textarea
   - Results display textarea
   - Submit and Deploy buttons
   - Status indicators and loading states
4. Add route to main router

### Phase 2: Backend API
1. Add develop routes to `server/routes.ts`
2. Implement command execution logic:
   - Spawn aider process with user prompt
   - Capture stdout/stderr output
   - Handle process completion/errors
3. Implement deployment logic:
   - Execute `npm run build`
   - Execute `pm2 restart ecosystem.config.cjs`
   - Capture build/deployment status

### Phase 3: Security & Error Handling
1. Add admin-only access control
2. Implement command sanitization
3. Add timeout handling for long-running commands
4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
5. Add logging for all develop page activities

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
1. Command history/logging
2. Real-time output streaming
3. Process cancellation capability
4. Backup/rollback functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Structure
```
client/src/pages/develop.tsx
├── PromptInput component
├── ResultsDisplay component
├── ActionButtons component
└── StatusIndicators component
```

### Backend Structure
```
server/routes.ts
├── POST /api/develop/execute
├── POST /api/develop/deploy
└── GET /api/develop/status
```

### Command Execution
- Use Node.js `child_process.spawn()` for aider execution
- Capture both stdout and stderr
- Implement timeout mechanism
- Handle process termination

### Deployment Process
1. Execute `npm run build` in project root
2. Check build exit code
3. If successful, execute `pm2 restart ecosystem.config.cjs`
4. Return deployment status to frontend

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Restrict to admin users only (`requireAdmin` middleware)
- Add additional permission checks if needed

### Command Safety
- Validate aider is available on system
- Sanitize input prompts (remove dangerous characters)
- Limit command execution time
- Run commands in project directory only

### Process Management
- Prevent multiple simultaneous aider executions
- Implement command queuing if needed
- Handle zombie processes

## Questions to Answer

### Technical Questions
1. **Aider Installation**: Is aider installed globally or locally? What's the exact command path?
2. **Working Directory**: What directory should aider commands execute in?
3. **Environment Variables**: Does aider need specific environment variables set?
4. **Command Timeout**: What's a reasonable timeout for aider commands (5 minutes? 10 minutes)?
5. **Concurrent Execution**: Should we allow multiple aider commands to run simultaneously?
6. **Output Streaming**: Do we need real-time output streaming or is batch output sufficient?

### Security Questions
1. **User Permissions**: Should this be restricted to super-admin only, or all admin users?
2. **Command Validation**: What input validation/sanitization is needed for prompts?
3. **File System Access**: Should we restrict which files aider can modify?
4. **Audit Logging**: What level of logging is needed for compliance/debugging?

### Deployment Questions
1. **Build Process**: Is `npm run build` the correct build command?
2. **PM2 Configuration**: Is `ecosystem.config.cjs` the correct PM2 config file?
3. **Deployment Verification**: How do we verify successful deployment?
4. **Rollback Strategy**: What happens if deployment fails?
5. **Downtime**: Is brief downtime during restart acceptable?

### User Experience Questions
1. **Command History**: Should we store/display previous commands and results?
2. **Progress Indicators**: How detailed should progress feedback be?
3. **Error Handling**: How should we display errors to users?
4. **Session Management**: What happens if user navigates away during command execution?

### Infrastructure Questions
1. **Resource Limits**: Are there CPU/memory limits we need to consider?
2. **Disk Space**: Could aider operations fill up disk space?
3. **Network Access**: Does aider need internet access for AI API calls?
4. **Backup Strategy**: Should we backup before allowing modifications?

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Code Injection**: Malicious prompts could potentially harm the system
- **System Instability**: Bad aider changes could break the application
- **Data Loss**: Incorrect modifications could corrupt data

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Long-running aider commands could affect server performance
- **Deployment Failures**: Failed deployments could cause downtime
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Multiple commands could consume system resources

### Low Risk
- **UI Responsiveness**: Long commands might make interface feel unresponsive
- **User Confusion**: Complex aider output might be hard to interpret

## Success Criteria
1. Admin users can successfully execute aider commands from web interface
2. Command output is clearly displayed to users
3. Deployment process works reliably
4. No security vulnerabilities introduced
5. System remains stable during and after operations
6. Proper error handling and user feedback
7. Audit trail of all development activities

## Dependencies
- Node.js `child_process` module
- Aider CLI tool installed on server
- PM2 process manager
- Admin authentication system
- Proper file permissions for build/deployment
